               `Auto-Green was thought of , due to low productivity of plants in Rwanda that is caused of poor maintenance of greenhouses.
               Mostly plants in greenhouses die of lack of water(wilting) and poor temperature control under greenhouses which cause low productivity of greenhouse crops.

            These green houses are usually built in houses with glass or plastic in which plants will be grown in controlled conditions.

            </p>  <p>&#8594;	It focuses on saving water , increasing efficiency and reducing the environmental impacts on plant production.
